Geometric Algebra using wxMaxima (GAwxM)

 The readme_setup.odt file contains the motivation for GAwxM, the Installation and Setup for Windows with a top-level workflow.

 The readme_works.odt file describes how it works...infix operators, active documents, initialization and validation.

 The readme_xfunctions.odt file lists the extrinsic functions (rather than intrinsic maxima functions) in each of the files within the two functions folders and also the three files in the initialize folder.
