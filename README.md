Geometric Algebra using wxMaxima (GAwxM)

 The motivation for the development of this repository was the web-based, published paper, 'A Survey of Geometric Algebra and Geometric Calculus.'

 Examples have been sourced from the two books; 'Linear and Geometric Algebra' (LAGA) and 'Vector and Geometric Calculus'. The two acronyms, 'laga' and 'gawxm' may be used together to search in a browser for the context of the repository.
 
 The readme_setup.pdf (and.odt) files contain the Installation and Setup for Windows with a top-level workflow.

 The readme_works.odt file describes how it works...infix operators, active documents, initialization and validation.

 The readme_xfunctions.odt file lists the extrinsic functions (rather than intrinsic maxima functions) in each of the files within the two functions folders and also the three files in the initialize folder.
