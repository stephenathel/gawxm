Geometric Algebra using wxMaxima (GAwxM)

  The motivation for the development of this repository was the web-based, published paper, A Survey of Geometric Algebra and Geometric Calculus.

 Examples have been sourced from the two books, abbreviated LAGA and VAGC. These two four-letter acronyms may be used together to search in a browser for the context of GAwxM.
 
 The readme_setup.odt file contains the motivation for GAwxM, the Installation and Setup for Windows with a top-level workflow.

 The readme_works.odt file describes how it works...infix operators, active documents, initialization and validation.

 The readme_xfunctions.odt file lists the extrinsic functions (rather than intrinsic maxima functions) in each of the files within the two functions folders and also the three files in the initialize folder.
